# Tower Ideas

Basic Turret [Lv 1] - Same as old turr

Heal - same as old turr

Farm - same as old turr

Drone Tower [Lv ???] [Nature?] - Spawns drones that automatically follow the nearest enemy, upon touch rams them and both the drone and enemy lose
 health. Doesn't move THAT fast.

Tesla Coil [Lv ???] [Electric] - Zaps nearby enemies, electricty can chain to others if close enough

Tower [Lv ???] [Offensive] - Allows increased FoV if player is inside of it.

Reactor [Lv ???] [Nature?] - A radioactive zone that infects players with fallout when entered, which continues to deal damage for a few seconds. The damage dealt decreases slowly over time


# Other Ideas
Super Energy Fields - Spawns once in a while, after 30 seconds a lot of orbs spawn. There is also a super energy guardian tower which has infinite health and damages you in some way that protects the field. Collecting orbs give super energy.

Super energy generator - a tower which you use super energy to build, but it can generate super energy (etc. costs 20 super energy but generates 40, but it can still be killed and has edium hp)
This makes super energy generate skill oriented since u need to protect it long enough to profit in super energy


Super energy used to buy final tower in final tier, super rare, capped at 50. 

You get super energy from killing other players and draining 20% of their super energy if they had any
Super energy DOES NOT naturally generate
