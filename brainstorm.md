bruh ill be ba

ENEMY IDEAS:

* - ***** star difficulty
***** + = Very difficult

* = ez pz lemon squeezy
** = you cant die to it unless you're really bad but meh could be a nuisance
*** = start being careful around it, you'll have to think about dodging its projectiles or using strategies
**** = you really need to use some strategies for this enemy, most average players will begin failing to solo this
***** = probably requires teamwork strategies to defeat, soloing this enemy may not be easy but it could be doable if you're pro

***** ***** - This is your rather difficult boss. You'll need quite a lot of people to even think about taking this down. Soloing this will be basically impossible without dev hacks or extreme skill, and dying will be rather common around this.

***** ***** ***** - This boss is a significant challenge. No solo can possibly kill this even with enough skill. A duo will be humanly possible but just barely. Bullets will mostly be instakills and even placing towers in a way such that they damage these bosses before being instantly wiped will become a challenge.

***** ***** ***** ***** = you'll need around 8 people at least to defeat this with perfect coordination and perfect strategy

* = easy, minimal issues
** = might die to
*** = hard, can defeat once u get hang of it quickly
**** = really hard, needs good teamwork
***** = needs lots of skill to kill, hard to maste

GROUND
soldier * - medium hp, low dmg, low spd, melee
archer * - low hp, low dmg, medium spd, ranged
machine gunner ** - low hp, low dmg, low spd, ranged, high reload
medic ** - low hp, low heal, medium spd, ranged
ninja ** - low hp, medium dmg, high spd, melee
tank *** - high hp, medium dmg, low spd, ranged
calvary *** - medium hp, high dmg, high spd, melee
missile launcher **** - high hp, high dmg, low spd, ranged, low reload
quantum cannon ***** - medium hp, high dmg, low spd, ranged

AIR
toy plane * - low hp, low dmg, medium spd, melee (dives into base)
fighter jet *** - medium hp, medium dmg, fast spd, ranged
bomber jet *** - low hp, high dmg, medium spd, close ranged
tsar bomber ***** - high hp, high dmg, high spd, close ranged (final levels)

BOSSES

Empyrean ***** ***** ***** ***** - Impossible HP, Impossible DMG, Low speed, all ranges will be damaged (last level)




(myb later) MARINE




tadpole -> frog
        -> poison frog

tadpole - fast rammer (will not jump)

frog - medium size, spits a stream of water from its mouth and "jumps" (boosts)

poison frog - small enemy that spits poison, not as fast as frog

slug - slow and little hp, melee, but spawns in big numbers


OR we can stop using animals since animals r kinda restrictive idk but tadpole/nymph should not jump since tadpoles have no legs. Also there is no need for "normal". Just like how theres no "base" animal on Earth.


 bug: shooting enemy bullet doens't die after hitting base (bruh how does this happen)
 bug: still says killed by ??? (tf)

 also we prolly wont use created enemies in real game but we use it as a base to create more interesting, for example an enemy that splits into smaller enemies, for strong it could be golem which is super slow, and fast couldd be nymph except nymph has no collisions and is slightly transparent (and maybe cant be hit by hard objects like bullets or cannonballs which could be confusing unless we add some text idk)

 no we should, we need basic enemy types before interesting ones...

basically enemies shouldn't be boring weak ones. Nobody wants an enemy who they can 1shot and wont reach bases. Plus this will blow electriciy and volcano way out of preportion in terms of power.
Instead enemies will all be rather strong.
Instead of makign super boring waves at the beginning, it should start medium-hard and go to super hard instead of starting super ez. Nobody likes easy waves, even the noobs find it boring. Like who wants a wave with a 100% pass rate? It just wastes your time
I don't think elixir is a good idea. It's another mechanic to add, not only increase packet size but make the game even more complex and there's basically no way to tell how much elixir other people have. If you make people bigger that actually nerfs them, but making them smaller will make everything unreadable. Adding text will look bad too... and adding borders or changing colors will also look trash bc the outer ring shows element
Just spawn more enemies based on more ppl. Don't spawn harder enemies, just more enemies. It makes a lot more sense, irl if u see u have a lot of enemies ur gonnna ask ur friend to help instead of just suddenly being stronger. Also makes the game more fun and more coordinated in terms of attacks.

first waves needs to be easy, rn enemies insta u the moment u touch them which is op af, first waves enemies should be about 150 hp and do way less dmg, especially to players. Also base healing to max in between waves makes more sense since when you're fighting it doesn't rlly make sense that you're rebuilding your castle. But no it should NOT start off medium-hard that's idiot game design. First waves all need to be easy, especially ones that introduce new enemy types. If you make the first waves hard our user retention will be shit. This isn't the world's hardest game or your bullet hell impossible games. look at skap for example, it has rooms, which are insanely easy but you still need to pay attention. It helps you grasp the mechanics of skap while still being pretty fun to platform through. Thats what we need. Essentially wave 1 we have the basic enemies, wave 2 we can introduce a new enemy to keep ppl engaged, wave 3 we can introduce yet another enemy, wave 4 and wave 5 we mix those enemies, then etc. this way ppl will see there's new content and it'll be fun to fight against diff types but at the same time it'll be easy and get them used to the mechanics. Easy levels also gives them time to farm xp and devise strategies.

Yeah ok

I think you desync tronsi


Ok so my friends played it at like 1 am
Basically
Toxin is a little bit on the powerful side. Slight nerf to damage, like 10% or so

Rock and Metal are useless. As fuck.

enemy names
nymph, (very fast)
cyborg, (just a powerful enemy overall)
golem, (tanky)
enforcer, (helps protect other enemies)
blazer, (close range fire enemy)
framethrower, (another close range fire enemy)
freezer, (self explanatory)
ember, (long range fire enemy)
intoxicator, (poisoner)
preserver (helps protect other enemies in a way that differs from the enforcer)
marine (moves fast)
mecha (powerful)
mortar (large hp)
catapult (large range)

empyrean (the strongest boss to exist)


Electricity is SUPER overpowered. There is literally no way to beat it now, it deals so much damage and the tower is rather spammable. It needs to take a huge nerf, it's like SS tier. Even I can't beat my friends when they use electricity and I use something that isn't electricity, and normally I wipe them off in 2 seconds


They also want a tower that lasts like 1 minute and is very spammable but basically just blocks projectiles.

also instead of closing websocket if cors is triggered, send a mg to their websocket saying pls turn off your vpn or proxy as the error message that way ppl odnt get triggered since vn and proxy can hide ur origin which could trigger cors. Otherwise we can also force a recaptcha as a double safety precaution

btw I have baalcned change ideas that we need to add:

- toxin should get more attack, if u look at the total stats (not just adding but weighting them, like defense / 100, fov squared, etc.) then toxin's total stats is pretty bad, it should be more like a slightly better water, so like 125 defense and 1.1 attack or smth like that since its speed is still pretty low at only 9.6

- laser tower needs rework, it doesn't fit light's aggro playstyle since its just kinda slow and short ranged, and its not good on defnese either bc of its low hp. Instead we should make laser tower spin rlly fast but do less dmg, so it kinda forces ppl to run away from it , that way its a lot better for defense or even offense.

- we odnt work on bots yet, we still need to rework the respawn screen os that it fades in such that ads can load. That way income will basically like double and also that way we can make respawn a button as well that way we can incoroporate rewarded video ads as well


> Normal Enemies

Soldier

Boss

--
note -> these hp values are just for fun. Based on how OP they are we can adjust them later (for example, if 30k HP turns out to be nothing we can buff that, or if it turns out to be unkillable we can nerf that)



- Soldiers
People Needed to Beat: 1 (blindfolded and using feet)


Types: Tank, Basic, Healer
Tank -> 350 hp, it doens't do anything - all damage is from ram
Basic -> 120 hp, it's basically just a moving basic tower
Healer -> 180 hp, it rams but it also heals other enemies within range of them, which makes this super unique

- Corporals
People Needed to Beat: 1 (with eyes closed)


Types: Fire, Water, earth

Fire -> 300 hp, just a moving bomb tower
Water -> 350 hp, just a moving streamer tower
Earth -> 380 hp, just a moving splinter tower


- Sergeants
People Needed to Beat: 1 (very low skill)


Types: Fire, Water, Earth

Fire -> 600 hp. It shoots bombs towards players, then in a direction 180 degrees away from its movement, it shoots 3 bullets (in around a 30 degree angle from each other) in rapid succession every 3 seconds, while boosting forwards at high speed.

Water -> 650 hp. It has a main streamer turret with 2 smaller turrets 180 degrees away from it which, every 5 seconds, shoot and turn into drown towers after 1 second

Earth -> 700 hp. Shoots a splinter bullet as well as 2 basic bullets as its main attack. Every few seconds it will shield itself and be invulnerable to attacks for 1 second before reverting. During the time, ram damage is greatly increased


- Commanders
People Needed to Beat: 1 (medium skill)


Uh I don't know how to describe them anymore. but, fire = 900 hp, water = 1010 hp, earth = 1130 hp

- Generals
People Needed to Beat: 1 (high skill)


Ok at this point there's like 15 turrets per enemy in my plan so there is absolutely no way to describe it that makes sense...

Fire -> 1700 hp, water -> 1900 hp, earth = 2200 hp

- Boss
People Needed to Beat: 1 (super high skill), or 2 (medium skill)


Yeah each has 25 turrets and some are stacked, these will also spawn sergeants once in a while (and even commanders rarely)

Fire -> 10000 hp, Water -> 11500 hp, Earth = 12000 hp

- Major Boss
People Needed to Beat: 2-3 (super high skill), or 5 (medium skill), or 15 noobs

... each one has about ~40 turrets and the design takes up literally my entire paper, how do I describe smhhhhh

Fire -> 30000 hp, Water -> 35000 hp, Earth - 40000 hp

It spawns seargeants and sometimes commanders


- Chief Boss
People Needed to Beat: 7 (very very high skill), 15 (medium skill), or 30 noobs

So basically this will be an impossible boss to defeat without constant coordination and strategy. It will only appear in the LAST wave of both boss fight and siege mode. 

I haven't planned this yet, but I'm thinking only 1 type. It will combine fire water and earth turrets into one crazy op boss. Don't worry about server lag, remmeber when bots were there that was like 20 people spamming turrets and it never lagged. This will probably generate the same amount of bullets but in a smaller area (but cuz quadtree it will lag almost the same amount). It will probably have at least 70 turrets though... but some of them will fire very rarely (ie, a 100 size bullet that instakills everything with infinite pierce but reload is like 8s)

It will spawn Generals and very rarely Bosses every once in a while

The HP will be around 100,000.
Yes, 100k.
It's the last wave what do you expect.










Ideas

Magma Upgrades!
Magma -> Lava (defense), Smoke (offense & speed)
Lava -> Obsidian (defense), Ash (normal)
Smoke -> Incense (defense), Oxygen (offense)


update.js 512 does not work idk why

i figured it out updatepack was not runing since i was handdling bullet in the tower itself while the bullet.changed is run in the bullet loop

noob.


instead of

Light -> Dark

Dark -> Shadow, Ghost, Void

Dark Tower -> Karma, becomes much more powerful upon taking damage


electricity tesla coil shouldnt be that hard anyways ill probably be back very late at night so uh whatever


Metal - shoots a strong bullet that deals 5x dmg to towers


Titanium - Shield Tower


TIER 3 iS ALL ATTACKING TOWERS

Ideas:

each element effects should not effect opposing element, for example burn effect from fires will not affect water, freeze effect from waters will not affect earths, and effects from earth will not affect fires idk, this will at least encourage diversity rather than ppl camping the same element

^^ will confuse new playrs tho so I might have to update tutorial if we add this or smth

Metal -  

Ice - shoots ice cubes which freeze you upon contact, its simple concept but it'll work

Plasma - 




Random Ideas

Qualities of Ice
Freezing others
Melting (into puddles)
Having low friction (initially)
Frostbite
Slowing things down
Being brittle, but acts like a shield
Countering fire very well

Qualities of Metal
Strong and difficult to break
Vulnerable to fire (will melt and become bruhed)
Slow and dense (hard to control)
Great at cutting things (melee)

Qualities of Plasma
Not a fluid or a solid
Very hot (can melt everything)
Can phase through things (it's plasma what do you expect)
Very low density (should move rather quickly)
Plasma is affected by electric and magnetic fields in ways not seen in other forms of matter. These fields can influence plasmas over great distances, pinching, warping and shaping them, as like the sun. Thus, we must make our plasma element act the same way - it is way more vulnerable to outside forces, but it can also damage others a lot






Tower Brainstorm
Magma - Volcano (explodes 2 seconds after being placed with a huge aoe effect and 8 smlal bullets in all directions)
Fire II - Burn (If you're within a radius of it, you get burned, meaning you lose hp, you're slower, and your energy doesn't gain back as fast, for a few seconds. The effect wears off after some time)
Plasma - Phase (upon placemenent, you go through towers and bullets, as well as having increased speed. Used to witchunt or perhaps defend? When the tower dies (which is around 2-3 seconds unless it's destroyed faster), you are back to normal)


Water II - Water Jet (It shoots bullets that both damage and slow the player down)
Ice - A0 Cannon - shoots icicles/cold bullets that also slows towers/players

Barrier (Enemies cannot place any towers in a radius of this tower), or an ice sniper
Electricity - Tesla Coil

Earth II - Tank (in a radius of this tower, you cannot take any damage - obvs doesnt last long and costs a lot)
Rock - Catapult (High speed, medium damage, low reload tower - maybe the ammo can also slowly slow down over time?)
Metal - Rust (over time, it decays, releasing slow-moving particles that deal small damage but slow players down a bit upon touch)

# CANNOT ADD 0 DECAY TOWERS DUE TO THE WAY PLAYER ID IS GENERATED OR MAKE 0 DECAY TOWERS DIE AFTER PLAYER LEAVES/DIES

# 2nd Tower For Elements

#Fire
Bomb Tower;

Propellent - When you walk over it, you are boosted in the same direction as towards the center of the tower

// maybe for a future element: Flames - Radius in which all enemy things lose hp

#Water
Streamliner;

Drowner - Players within a radius of this move slower


#Earth
Splinter - but at the end, it splits into 3 but have a short range like a "blooming flower"

Tower actually makes more sense, especially since how good earth was with the high fov 

// Core - Gives itself energy within radius

# Tower Ideas

Basic Turret [Lv 1] - Same as old turr

Heal - same as old turr

Farm - same as old turr

Towers gained in each tier
Tier 1 - Basic (0k)
Tier 2 - Two Regular Towers (3k)
Tier 3 (Puberty) - One Regular Tower (15k)
Tier 4 - one regular tower + one cheap super energy tower (50k)
Tier 5 - one expensive super energy tower + super energy farm (150k)

Fire -
Bomb Tower




Decimator very original idea (all players within radius lose health & towers, except u)

Ice 
Frostbite - you slowly lose hp and move much slower in a radius around this tower. Projectiles are also slightly slowed.

Water
Liquifier - very short radius, but within this radius your body will liquify, making you immune to damage until the tower dies (tower has quick decay and low hp) BASICALLY bullets pass through you, so you can't body block either

Drowner - Enemies within a radius of this don't gain energy back

Earth Tower

Heavy - you are slightly immune to things that damage you (you take less damage) within radius of this

Invisible - Towers cannot detect you within a radius

ZeroTixTrash - kills all players named ZeroTix in the arena upon being placed (great idea add it now)

Vision (you gain extra FOV within a radius of this tower)

Ceptionist - Shoots bullets which shoots bullets at players

Mine - Shoots a bullet which leaves a very deadly high damage trail behind it


Random Tower Idea
Glass TOWER - Upon death, it explodes and deals 60 damage to everything in a high radius. Be careful.


3rd coil lights, 2nd coil lights, then 1st coil lights, then it attacks


Drone Tower [Lv ???] [Nature?] - Spawns drones that automatically follow the nearest enemy, upon touch rams them and both the drone and enemy lose
 health. Doesn't move THAT fast.

Tesla Coil [Lv ???] [Electric] - Zaps nearby enemies, electricty can chain to others if close enough

Tower [Lv ???] [Offensive] - Allows increased FoV if player is inside of it.

Reactor [Lv ???] [Nature?] - A radioactive zone that infects players with fallout when entered, which continues to deal damage for a few seconds. The damage dealt decreases slowly over time


# Other Ideas
Super Energy Fields - Spawns once in a while, after 30 seconds a lot of orbs spawn. There is also a super energy guardian tower which has infinite health and damages you in some way that protects the field. Collecting orbs give super energy.

Super energy generator - a tower which you use super energy to build, but it can generate super energy (etc. costs 20 super energy but generates 40, but it can still be killed and has edium hp)
This makes super energy generate skill oriented since u need to protect it long enough to profit in super energy


Super energy used to buy final tower in final tier, super rare, capped at 50. 

You get super energy from killing other players and draining 20% of their super energy if they had any
Super energy DOES NOT naturally generate

#Earth III Tower - Teleporter
Stay in it without moving for 1 second to be teleported to a random spot on the arena
