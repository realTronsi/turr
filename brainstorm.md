# CANNOT ADD 0 DECAY TOWERS DUE TO THE WAY PLAYER ID IS GENERATED OR MAKE 0 DECAY TOWERS DIE AFTER PLAYER LEAVES/DIES

# 2nd Tower For Elements

#Fire
Bomb Tower;

Propellent - When you walk over it, you are boosted in the same direction as towards the center of the tower

// maybe for a future element: Flames - Radius in which all enemy things lose hp

#Water
Streamliner;

Drowner - Players within a radius of this move slower


#Earth
Splinter - but at the end, it splits into 3 but have a short range like a "blooming flower"

Core - Gives itself energy within radius

// names that actually make sense: Core, Reactor

// for later earth elements tower Pull - Pulls players in and damages them upon contact

 
// for later earth elements Tower - When inside, you gain FOV


# Tower Ideas

Basic Turret [Lv 1] - Same as old turr

Heal - same as old turr

Farm - same as old turr

Towers gained in each tier
Tier 1 - Basic (0k)
Tier 2 - Two Regular Towers (3k)
Tier 3 (Puberty) - One Regular Tower (15k)
Tier 4 - one regular tower + one cheap super energy tower (50k)
Tier 5 - one expensive super energy tower + super energy farm (150k)

Fire -
Bomb Tower




Decimator very original idea (all players within radius lose health & towers, except u)

Ice 
Frostbite - you slowly lose hp and move much slower in a radius around this tower. Projectiles are also slightly slowed.

Water
Liquifier - very short radius, but within this radius your body will liquify, making you immune to damage until the tower dies (tower has quick decay and low hp) BASICALLY bullets pass through you, so you can't body block either

Drowner - Enemies within a radius of this don't gain energy back

Earth Tower

Heavy - you are slightly immune to things that damage you (you take less damage) within radius of this

Invisible - Towers cannot detect you within a radius

ZeroTixTrash - kills all players named ZeroTix in the arena upon being placed (great idea add it now)

Vision (you gain extra FOV within a radius of this tower)

Ceptionist - Shoots bullets which shoots bullets at players

Mine - Shoots a bullet which leaves a very deadly high damage trail behind it


Random Tower Idea
Glass TOWER - Upon death, it explodes and deals 60 damage to everything in a high radius. Be careful.





Drone Tower [Lv ???] [Nature?] - Spawns drones that automatically follow the nearest enemy, upon touch rams them and both the drone and enemy lose
 health. Doesn't move THAT fast.

Tesla Coil [Lv ???] [Electric] - Zaps nearby enemies, electricty can chain to others if close enough

Tower [Lv ???] [Offensive] - Allows increased FoV if player is inside of it.

Reactor [Lv ???] [Nature?] - A radioactive zone that infects players with fallout when entered, which continues to deal damage for a few seconds. The damage dealt decreases slowly over time


# Other Ideas
Super Energy Fields - Spawns once in a while, after 30 seconds a lot of orbs spawn. There is also a super energy guardian tower which has infinite health and damages you in some way that protects the field. Collecting orbs give super energy.

Super energy generator - a tower which you use super energy to build, but it can generate super energy (etc. costs 20 super energy but generates 40, but it can still be killed and has edium hp)
This makes super energy generate skill oriented since u need to protect it long enough to profit in super energy


Super energy used to buy final tower in final tier, super rare, capped at 50. 

You get super energy from killing other players and draining 20% of their super energy if they had any
Super energy DOES NOT naturally generate

#Earth III Tower - Teleporter
Stay in it without moving for 1 second to be teleported to a random spot on the arena



# Rank Ideas
