note -> these hp values are just for fun. Based on how OP they are we can adjust them later (for example, if 30k HP turns out to be nothing we can buff that, or if it turns out to be unkillable we can nerf that)



- Soldiers
People Needed to Beat: 1 (blindfolded and using feet)


Types: Tank, Basic, Healer
Tank -> 350 hp, it doens't do anything - all damage is from ram
Basic -> 120 hp, it's basically just a moving basic tower
Healer -> 180 hp, it rams but it also heals other enemies within range of them, which makes this super unique

- Corporals
People Needed to Beat: 1 (with eyes closed)


Types: Fire, Water, earth

Fire -> 300 hp, just a moving bomb tower
Water -> 350 hp, just a moving streamer tower
Earth -> 380 hp, just a moving splinter tower


- Sergeants
People Needed to Beat: 1 (very low skill)


Types: Fire, Water, Earth

Fire -> 600 hp. It shoots bombs towards players, then in a direction 180 degrees away from its movement, it shoots 3 bullets (in around a 30 degree angle from each other) in rapid succession every 3 seconds, while boosting forwards at high speed.

Water -> 650 hp. It has a main streamer turret with 2 smaller turrets 180 degrees away from it which, every 5 seconds, shoot and turn into drown towers after 1 second

Earth -> 700 hp. Shoots a splinter bullet as well as 2 basic bullets as its main attack. Every few seconds it will shield itself and be invulnerable to attacks for 1 second before reverting. During the time, ram damage is greatly increased


- Commanders
People Needed to Beat: 1 (medium skill)


Uh I don't know how to describe them anymore. but, fire = 900 hp, water = 1010 hp, earth = 1130 hp

- Generals
People Needed to Beat: 1 (high skill)


Ok at this point there's like 15 turrets per enemy in my plan so there is absolutely no way to describe it that makes sense...

Fire -> 1700 hp, water -> 1900 hp, earth = 2200 hp

- Boss
People Needed to Beat: 1 (super high skill), or 2 (medium skill)


Yeah each has 25 turrets and some are stacked, these will also spawn sergeants once in a while (and even commanders rarely)

Fire -> 10000 hp, Water -> 11500 hp, Earth = 12000 hp

- Major Boss
People Needed to Beat: 2-3 (super high skill), or 5 (medium skill), or 15 noobs

... each one has about ~40 turrets and the design takes up literally my entire paper, how do I describe smhhhhh

Fire -> 30000 hp, Water -> 35000 hp, Earth - 40000 hp

It spawns seargeants and sometimes commanders


- Chief Boss
People Needed to Beat: 7 (very very high skill), 15 (medium skill), or 30 noobs

So basically this will be an impossible boss to defeat without constant coordination and strategy. It will only appear in the LAST wave of both boss fight and siege mode. 

I haven't planned this yet, but I'm thinking only 1 type. It will combine fire water and earth turrets into one crazy op boss. Don't worry about server lag, remmeber when bots were there that was like 20 people spamming turrets and it never lagged. This will probably generate the same amount of bullets but in a smaller area (but cuz quadtree it will lag almost the same amount). It will probably have at least 70 turrets though... but some of them will fire very rarely (ie, a 100 size bullet that instakills everything with infinite pierce but reload is like 8s)

It will spawn Generals and very rarely Bosses every once in a while

The HP will be around 100,000.
Yes, 100k.
It's the last wave what do you expect.










Ideas

Magma Upgrades!
Magma -> Lava (defense), Smoke (offense & speed)
Lava -> Obsidian (defense), Ash (normal)
Smoke -> Incense (defense), Oxygen (offense)


update.js 512 does not work idk why

i figured it out updatepack was not runing since i was handdling bullet in the tower itself while the bullet.changed is run in the bullet loop

noob.


instead of

 hi
 hi
>hi

do

hi
hi
> hi

Water -> Acid

Elements That work
Basic
Fire
Magma 
Plasma
Water
Ice 
Electricity
Earth
Rock
Metal


Frame-rate independent friction
position += velocity * (drag^(dt*dt) - 1) / (dt*ln(drag));
velocity *= pow(drag, dt);



Yellow: FFD249
Red: db4f00



Fire Element -> #c4160a
Magma Element -> #ad3434
Earth Element -> #1b8c1d
Metal Element -> #43464b
Rock Element -> #632305
Water Element -> #0b58a1
Plasma Element -> #a82ca2
Electricity Element -> #b2bd22

Poison Element -> #4ced37


# UPGRADES
Fire -> Light, Magma (Volcano Tower), Plasma
Water -> Water II, Ice, Electricity
Earth -> Earth II, Rock, Metal

Light -> Dark

Dark -> Shadow, Ghost, Void

Dark Tower -> Karma, becomes much more powerful upon taking damage


electricity tesla coil shouldnt be that hard anyways ill probably be back very late at night so uh whatever


Metal - shoots a strong bullet that deals 5x dmg to towers


Titanium - Shield Tower


TIER 3 iS ALL ATTACKING TOWERS

Ideas:

each element effects should not effect opposing element, for example burn effect from fires will not affect water, freeze effect from waters will not affect earths, and effects from earth will not affect fires idk, this will at least encourage diversity rather than ppl camping the same element

^^ will confuse new playrs tho so I might have to update tutorial if we add this or smth

Metal -  

Ice - shoots ice cubes which freeze you upon contact, its simple concept but it'll work

Plasma - 




Random Ideas

Qualities of Ice
Freezing others
Melting (into puddles)
Having low friction (initially)
Frostbite
Slowing things down
Being brittle, but acts like a shield
Countering fire very well

Qualities of Metal
Strong and difficult to break
Vulnerable to fire (will melt and become bruhed)
Slow and dense (hard to control)
Great at cutting things (melee)

Qualities of Plasma
Not a fluid or a solid
Very hot (can melt everything)
Can phase through things (it's plasma what do you expect)
Very low density (should move rather quickly)
Plasma is affected by electric and magnetic fields in ways not seen in other forms of matter. These fields can influence plasmas over great distances, pinching, warping and shaping them, as like the sun. Thus, we must make our plasma element act the same way - it is way more vulnerable to outside forces, but it can also damage others a lot






Tower Brainstorm
Magma - Volcano (explodes 2 seconds after being placed with a huge aoe effect and 8 smlal bullets in all directions)
Fire II - Burn (If you're within a radius of it, you get burned, meaning you lose hp, you're slower, and your energy doesn't gain back as fast, for a few seconds. The effect wears off after some time)
Plasma - Phase (upon placemenent, you go through towers and bullets, as well as having increased speed. Used to witchunt or perhaps defend? When the tower dies (which is around 2-3 seconds unless it's destroyed faster), you are back to normal)


Water II - Water Jet (It shoots bullets that both damage and slow the player down)
Ice - A0 Cannon - shoots icicles/cold bullets that also slows towers/players

Barrier (Enemies cannot place any towers in a radius of this tower), or an ice sniper
Electricity - Tesla Coil

Earth II - Tank (in a radius of this tower, you cannot take any damage - obvs doesnt last long and costs a lot)
Rock - Catapult (High speed, medium damage, low reload tower - maybe the ammo can also slowly slow down over time?)
Metal - Rust (over time, it decays, releasing slow-moving particles that deal small damage but slow players down a bit upon touch)

# CANNOT ADD 0 DECAY TOWERS DUE TO THE WAY PLAYER ID IS GENERATED OR MAKE 0 DECAY TOWERS DIE AFTER PLAYER LEAVES/DIES

# 2nd Tower For Elements

#Fire
Bomb Tower;

Propellent - When you walk over it, you are boosted in the same direction as towards the center of the tower

// maybe for a future element: Flames - Radius in which all enemy things lose hp

#Water
Streamliner;

Drowner - Players within a radius of this move slower


#Earth
Splinter - but at the end, it splits into 3 but have a short range like a "blooming flower"

Tower actually makes more sense, especially since how good earth was with the high fov 

// Core - Gives itself energy within radius

# Tower Ideas

Basic Turret [Lv 1] - Same as old turr

Heal - same as old turr

Farm - same as old turr

Towers gained in each tier
Tier 1 - Basic (0k)
Tier 2 - Two Regular Towers (3k)
Tier 3 (Puberty) - One Regular Tower (15k)
Tier 4 - one regular tower + one cheap super energy tower (50k)
Tier 5 - one expensive super energy tower + super energy farm (150k)

Fire -
Bomb Tower




Decimator very original idea (all players within radius lose health & towers, except u)

Ice 
Frostbite - you slowly lose hp and move much slower in a radius around this tower. Projectiles are also slightly slowed.

Water
Liquifier - very short radius, but within this radius your body will liquify, making you immune to damage until the tower dies (tower has quick decay and low hp) BASICALLY bullets pass through you, so you can't body block either

Drowner - Enemies within a radius of this don't gain energy back

Earth Tower

Heavy - you are slightly immune to things that damage you (you take less damage) within radius of this

Invisible - Towers cannot detect you within a radius

ZeroTixTrash - kills all players named ZeroTix in the arena upon being placed (great idea add it now)

Vision (you gain extra FOV within a radius of this tower)

Ceptionist - Shoots bullets which shoots bullets at players

Mine - Shoots a bullet which leaves a very deadly high damage trail behind it


Random Tower Idea
Glass TOWER - Upon death, it explodes and deals 60 damage to everything in a high radius. Be careful.


3rd coil lights, 2nd coil lights, then 1st coil lights, then it attacks


Drone Tower [Lv ???] [Nature?] - Spawns drones that automatically follow the nearest enemy, upon touch rams them and both the drone and enemy lose
 health. Doesn't move THAT fast.

Tesla Coil [Lv ???] [Electric] - Zaps nearby enemies, electricty can chain to others if close enough

Tower [Lv ???] [Offensive] - Allows increased FoV if player is inside of it.

Reactor [Lv ???] [Nature?] - A radioactive zone that infects players with fallout when entered, which continues to deal damage for a few seconds. The damage dealt decreases slowly over time


# Other Ideas
Super Energy Fields - Spawns once in a while, after 30 seconds a lot of orbs spawn. There is also a super energy guardian tower which has infinite health and damages you in some way that protects the field. Collecting orbs give super energy.

Super energy generator - a tower which you use super energy to build, but it can generate super energy (etc. costs 20 super energy but generates 40, but it can still be killed and has edium hp)
This makes super energy generate skill oriented since u need to protect it long enough to profit in super energy


Super energy used to buy final tower in final tier, super rare, capped at 50. 

You get super energy from killing other players and draining 20% of their super energy if they had any
Super energy DOES NOT naturally generate

#Earth III Tower - Teleporter
Stay in it without moving for 1 second to be teleported to a random spot on the arena
